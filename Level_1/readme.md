# Level-1: Inception of open source EDA,OpenLANE and SKY130 PDK


## List of Objectives

- :microscope: <b>Practical Objective-1:</b> []()
  
 <div align="center">:star::star::star::star::star::star:</div> 

## :book:  1 : : SoC packaging and basic terms related to physical SoC chip
### :zap: 1.1  : : Big Picture
:rocket: Let's start with a development board (e.g.- Arduino, RasberryPi, Vsdsquadron etc) as the bigger picture for SoC application.

![1_sc_in](images/1_sc_in.png)

- Here we can observe the SoC is highlighted in the board. It performs all computing task.
- Other components and blocks are also present for interfacing.
- We consider it as chip, but this is the packaging and chip (semiconductor die) is inside it.
- The block diagram of the development board is shown below and we can observe that the SoC or processor is central block of the board.

### :zap: 1.2 : : Packaging
:rocket: Packaging means shielding the chip from external things and give proper and reliavle interfacing.

![1_sc_pc_1](images/1_sc_pc_1.png)

- It is a `QFN 48` package. QFN signifies Quad flat no leads.
- The chip is inside it. And the package leads are connected to the chip pins with `wire bound`. This is shown below.

### :zap: 1.3 : : Basic terms related to Physical SoC chip 


![1_sc_ph_1](images/1_sc_ph_1.png)

#### Die 
- Die is the total silicon wafer block for designing chip.
#### Core
- Core is the region or block defined in the die for logic circuit implementation.
- IPs, Macros,Cells are placed in this region.
#### Pads
- Pads are the interface between core (internal circuit) and package leads (external circuit) which manages data communication.
- These regions are defined in die.

#### Foundry IPs
- Foundry IP signifies Foundry (Manufacturing unit) provided Intellectual property.
- Any logic circuit (digital/analog/mixed) block that is pre-designed, verified reusable block.
- Analog IPs (DAC, PLL, ADC).

#### Macros
- Any logic circuit (digital/analog/mixed) block that is pre-designed, verified, post-layout block.
- Having specific functionality.
- Macros (RISC-V SoC, SPI).

## :book: 2 : : Hardware and software interfacing and ISA (RISC-V)
### :zap: 2.1 : : Introduction to ISA 
- ISA signifies instruction set architechture.
- It is the interface between hardware and software.
- `RISC-V` ISA is the open source ISA.

### :zap: 2.2 : : Software applications to hardware
![2_s2h_1](images/2_s2h_1.png)

- In the above image we can see the communication interface between application software and hardware through system software.
- Computers only understand binary format data.
- This binary data goes to SoC core layout and perform specific task based on transistors on / off.
- ISA specifies which combination of binary bits for which operation.
- Suppose `add r1 r1 r2' is an instruction in assembly language after compilation.
- Assembler (based on ISA) is converted to binary bits combinbination and passed to hardware (chip layout).
- ISA is abstract interface between application software and hardware.
- HDL (Verilog) helps to define ISA to hardware in RTL level.


![2_s2h_2](images/2_s2h_2.png)

- In the above figure a stopwatch application software is written in C language (any high level programming language).
- Then this C program is converted to assembly language using compiler.
- Then the assembler convert this to machine language.
- Machine language is passed to hardware layout and the stopwatch operation is performed.
