 <div align="center">:star::star::star::star::star::star:</div> 

## :book:  1 : : SoC packaging and basic terms related to physical SoC chip
### :zap: 1.1  : : Big Picture
:rocket: Let's start with a development board (e.g.- Arduino, RasberryPi, Vsdsquadron etc) as the bigger picture for SoC application.

![1_sc_in](images/1_sc_in.png)

- Here we can observe the SoC is highlighted in the board. It performs all computing task.
- Other components and blocks are also present for interfacing.
- We consider it as chip, but this is the packaging and chip (semiconductor die) is inside it.
- The block diagram of the development board is shown below and we can observe that the SoC or processor is central block of the board.

### :zap: 1.2 : : Packaging
:rocket: Packaging means shielding the chip from external things and give proper and reliavle interfacing.

![1_sc_pc_1](images/1_sc_pc_1.png)

- It is a `QFN 48` package. QFN signifies Quad flat no leads.
- The chip is inside it. And the package leads are connected to the chip pins with `wire bound`. This is shown below.

### :zap: 1.3 : : Basic terms related to Physical SoC chip 


![1_sc_ph_1](images/1_sc_ph_1.png)

#### Die 
- Die is the total silicon wafer block for designing chip.
#### Core
- Core is the region or block defined in the die for logic circuit implementation.
- IPs, Macros,Cells are placed in this region.
#### Pads
- Pads are the interface between core (internal circuit) and package leads (external circuit) which manages data communication.
- These regions are defined in die.

![1_sc_ph_2](images/1_sc_ph_2.png)

#### Foundry IPs
- Foundry IP signifies Foundry (Manufacturing unit) provided Intellectual property.
- Any logic circuit (digital/analog/mixed) block that is pre-designed, verified reusable block.
- Analog IPs (DAC, PLL, ADC).

#### Macros
- Any logic circuit (digital/analog/mixed) block that is pre-designed, verified, post-layout block.
- Having specific functionality.
- Macros (RISC-V SoC, SPI).

## :book: 2 : : Hardware and software interfacing and ISA (RISC-V)
### :zap: 2.1 : : Introduction to ISA 
- ISA signifies instruction set architechture.
- It is the interface between hardware and software.
- `RISC-V` ISA is the open source ISA.

---

### :zap: 2.2 : : Software applications to hardware
![2_s2h_1](images/2_s2h_1.png)

- In the above image we can see the communication interface between application software and hardware through system software.
- Computers only understand binary format data.
- This binary data goes to SoC core layout and perform specific task based on transistors on / off.
- ISA specifies which combination of binary bits for which operation.
- Suppose `add r1 r1 r2' is an instruction in assembly language after compilation.
- Assembler (based on ISA) is converted to binary bits combinbination and passed to hardware (chip layout).
- ISA is abstract interface between application software and hardware.
- HDL (Verilog) helps to define ISA to hardware in RTL level.


![2_s2h_2](images/2_s2h_2.png)

- In the above figure a stopwatch application software is written in C language (any high level programming language).
- Then this C program is converted to assembly language using compiler.
- Then the assembler convert this to machine language.
- Machine language is passed to hardware layout and the stopwatch operation is performed.

## :book: 3 : : Overview of the Opensource SoC design flow using OpenLANE
### :zap: 3.1 : : Opensource ASIC design flow
![3_as_in](images/3_as_in.png)

#### RTL designs
- These are the behavioral logic definition.
- These are generally weitten in HDL(Verilog).
- We can get opensource system/IP designs from the sources specified in the image. 

#### EDA tools
- These tools are required to analyze the RTL design and convert to GDSII.
- Some opensource EDA tools are yosys, OpenSTA, OpenROAD, Magic.

#### PDK
- In the early stage, `IC design` was integrated to manufacturing unit.
- To separate the `design` from `technology` PDK concept is invoked.
- PDK signifies Process design kit provided by foundry.
- PDK is collection of files
  - Device models
  - Process design rules
  - Standard cell libraries (timing, load etc)
- SKY130 PDK is a very popular opensource PDK for academic and research purpose.
  - 130 nm is the feature size for physical design.
  - It is old but supports enough fast design (around 1 GHz if properly designed) for research purpose.

### :zap: 3.2 : : RTL to GDSII flow
![3_r2g](images/3_r2g.png)

#### Synthesis
- Map standard cells from SCL for RTL design components and generate netlist.
- SCL is the standard cell library provided by pdk.
- Opensource tool: Yosys.
#### Floorplan and Power planning
- Create die and core as per cell requirement (netlist).
- Place Macros.
- PDN(Power distribution network) is generated.
- I/O pins are placed.
- Opensource tool: OpenROAD and magic.
#### Place
- Standard cells are placed in core.
- Detailed placement and optimization.
- Opensource tool: OpenROAD and magic.
#### Clock Tree Synthesis
- Clock network (clock buffers are placed).
- Opensource tool: TritonCTS and magic.
#### Route
- Cells are connected to each other (routing) and optimization in routing.
- Metal layers for routing.
- Opensource tool: TritonROUTE and magic.
- SKY130 PDK uses 6 metal layers. 
  - Lowest layer as `Local interconnect` and made of TiN.
  - Other five layers are made of aluminium.

![3_r2g_rt](images/3_r2g_rt)

#### Signoff
- Physical verification (DRC, LVS).
- Timing verification (STA).
- Opensource tool: OpenSTA, magic.

### :zap: 3.3 : : OpenLANE ASIC design flow
![3_ol_o](images/3_ol_o.png)

- Problems with opensource EDA tools was-
  - Tool qualification
  - Tool callibration
  - Missing tools
- To avoid this `OpenLANE`, a open source flow integrating different open source tools for tapeout experiment is designed.
- `striVe chipsets` are designed using the OpenLANE flow.

#### OpenLANE flow Characteristics
- Produce clean GDSII with no human in the loop.
- Clean means
 - LVS clean
 - DRC clean
 - Timing clean !! (Work in progress)

- Tuned for SKY130 PDK
- Two modes of operation
  - Autonomous
  - Interactive
- Design space exploration to find best set of flow
- Large number of design examples
#### Logic euivalence check (LEC)
- If netlist modified then verification is very important to check the required logic / function.
- PostCTS, PostRouting it is very important.
#### Fake antenna diodes insertion and swapping
- Why antenna rule violation occurs?
![3_an_1](images/3_an_1.png)
- Solution to Antenna rule violation.
